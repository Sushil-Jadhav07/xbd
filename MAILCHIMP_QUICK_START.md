   - Name
   - Email (required)
   - Organization
   - Designation

   - Message

4. **Submit** - the data goes directly to your Mailchimp list!

## Where Data Goes

All form submissions are sent to your Mailchimp audience:
- **List ID:** `345dda8b10`
- **Server:** `us11` (xbd.us11.list-manage.com)

## Check Your Mailchimp

After submitting a test form:
1. Log in to Mailchimp
