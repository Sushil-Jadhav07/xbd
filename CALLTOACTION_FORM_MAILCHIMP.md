   ```
   Then go to: `http://localhost:3000/about-anuj`

3. **Fill out the form** with test data:

   - Email: sarah@keynote-test.com
   - Enquiry Type: Keynote/Conference

4. **Submit** and watch for:

## Error Handling

The form handles various error scenarios:

- **Network Errors**: Shows "Network error. Please try again."
- **Timeout**: Shows "Request timeout. Please try again." (after 10 seconds)
- **Invalid Data**: Shows Mailchimp's specific error message
- **Duplicate Email**: Treats "already subscribed" as success
- **Missing Fields**: Shows "Please fill in all fields."

## Purpose & Use Cases

This form is specifically designed for:

1. **Keynote Speaking Requests**: Organizations booking Anuj for conferences
2. **Workshop Inquiries**: Companies interested in training sessions
3. **Consulting Services**: Businesses seeking strategic guidance
4. **Other Services**: General discovery calls and custom requests

## Separate from Other Forms

The Call to Action form uses a **different Mailchimp audience** than other forms:

| Form | Audience ID | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Lead Form Modal | `345dda8b10` | General leads & consultations |
| Contact Form | `cc2b411598` | General inquiries & support |
| **Call to Action** | **`480c6e3d8c`** | **Speaking, workshops, consulting** |

### Benefits of Separation:
- **Event Focus**: Specifically for speaking and workshop requests
- **Targeted Follow-up**: Custom responses for speaking inquiries
- **Better Analytics**: Track conversion for keynote/workshop leads
- **Custom Workflows**: Set up automation specific to event bookings
- **Professional Segmentation**: Separate high-value speaking opportunities

## Code Structure

```javascript
const CalltoAction = ({ callToActionData }) => {
  // State management
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ ... });
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [successMessage, setSuccessMessage] = useState('');
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');

  // Form handlers
  const handleInputChange = (e) => { ... }
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => { ... }
  
  // Mailchimp JSONP submission
  function submitToMailchimp(formData) { ... }

  return (
    // JSX with form and images
  );
};
```

## Design Maintained

The integration **preserves the original design**:

✅ Gray background (`bg-gray-100`)
✅ Gray input fields (`bg-gray-200`)
✅ Black submit button
✅ Social media icons
✅ Privacy statement
✅ Left/right grid layout with images
✅ Rounded corners and padding
✅ Responsive design
