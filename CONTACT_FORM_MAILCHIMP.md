# Contact Form Mailchimp Integration

## Overview

The contact form on the Contact page is now integrated with Mailchimp using JSONP (client-side submission). All form submissions are sent directly to a dedicated Mailchimp audience for contact inquiries.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Subject Field
- The "Subject" input field has been removed from the contact form as requested
- Form now has 5 fields: Name, Email, Phone, Company, and Message

### 2. Mailchimp Integration
- Added JSONP-based Mailchimp submission (same approach as LeadFormModal)
- Direct client-side submission to Mailchimp
- No API keys or server-side code required

### 3. Form Enhancements
- Added form validation for required fields (Name, Email, Message)
- Added success/error message display
- Added loading states during submission
- Form clears automatically on successful submission
- Disabled state for all inputs during submission

## Testing

To test the contact form integration:

1. **Navigate to Contact Page:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then go to: `http://localhost:3000/contact`

2. **Fill out the form** with test data:
   - Name: Test Contact
   - Email: test@contact-form.com
   - Phone: +91 98765 43210 (optional)
   - Company: Test Company (optional)
   - Message: Testing the contact form Mailchimp integration

3. **Submit** and watch for:
   - âœ… Button shows "Sending..."
   - âœ… Success message: "Thank you for contacting us! We will get back to you soon."
   - âœ… Form clears automatically

4. **Verify in Mailchimp:**
   - Log in to Mailchimp
   - Go to Audience with ID: `cc2b411598`
   - Check for the new contact with all fields populated

## Error Handling

The form handles various error scenarios:

- **Network Errors**: Shows "Network error. Please try again."
- **Timeout**: Shows "Request timeout. Please try again." (after 10 seconds)
- **Invalid Data**: Shows Mailchimp's specific error message
- **Duplicate Email**: Treats "already subscribed" as success

## Difference from Lead Form

The contact form uses a **different Mailchimp audience** than the lead form:

| Form | Audience ID | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Lead Form Modal | `345dda8b10` | Book calls, consultations, programs |
| Contact Form | `cc2b411598` | General inquiries, support, questions |

This separation allows you to:
- Track different types of leads separately
- Set up different automated workflows
- Apply different tags and segments
- Customize follow-up strategies

## File Modified

- **`/src/components/Contact/ContactPage.js`**
  - Added state management for form values
  - Added `submitToMailchimp()` function
  - Added `handleSubmit()` and `handleChange()` functions
  - Removed subject field
  - Added success/error message displays
  - Connected all inputs to state

## Code Structure

```javascript
const ContactPage = () => {
  // State management
  const [formValues, setFormValues] = useState({ ... });
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [successMessage, setSuccessMessage] = useState('');
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');

  // Form handlers
  function handleChange(e) { ... }
  async function handleSubmit(e) { ... }
  
  // Mailchimp JSONP submission
  function submitToMailchimp(formData) { ... }

  return (
    // JSX with form connected to handlers
  );
};
```

## Security

- **Honeypot Field**: Includes hidden field `b_279a02443a57a9821b4e42c23_cc2b411598` to prevent bot submissions
- **JSONP Safety**: Uses unique callback names to prevent conflicts
- **Timeout Protection**: Cleans up callbacks and script tags after timeout
- **Error Boundary**: Try-catch blocks prevent app crashes

## Benefits

1. **Two Separate Lists**: Lead inquiries and contact inquiries are kept separate
2. **No Backend Required**: Direct client-side submission
3. **Instant Feedback**: Users see immediate confirmation
4. **Professional UX**: Loading states and clear messaging
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design maintained
